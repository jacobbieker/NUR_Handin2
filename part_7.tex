\section{Part 7. QuadTree}

The file of the functions used for this exercise is:

\lstinputlisting{part_seven.py}

My script produces the following result, see Fig. \ref{fig:bhtree}. As can be seen, the BHTree does seem to mostly work.
In fact, while the plot seems to suggest that the BHTree did not correctly partition the space down to less than 12 particles
per node, from checking all the leaf nodes in the tree, I confirmed that there is no leaf nodes with more than 12 particles. So
something seems to be wrong with the plotting, but I was unable to fix that at this time.

The n = 0 multipole moment for the leaf node containg the particle with index i = 100 and that of
all its parent nodes up to the root node is shown here, along with the center of the box and width of the box that that
node represents:
