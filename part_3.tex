\section{Part 3. Linear Structure Growth}

The file of the functions used for this exercise is:

The result of this function is shown in \ref{fig:lgf}:

As can be seen from the plot, the numerical solution is close the analytical solution, but not exact.
The Runge-Kutta 4th order method was chosen for its ease of implementation and relative accuracy.
One issue that I was not able to figure out was for the third case, the analytical and numerical solutions differ by
quite a bit. This is unexpected, since the other two cases, it does match fairly closely. Infact, the third case, the numerical
solution seems to converge on the first case for some reason. Quite possibly going to a 5th order Runge-Kutta could fix the issue,
but there was not time to implement it.

I did not have time to determine why this is the case and fix it.
